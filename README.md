# Project : Car Rental System

Problem Statement:

Customers in today's car rental industry frequently encounter issues such as a lack of real-time vehicle availability, confusing pricing structures, time-consuming paperwork, and poor customer service. Additionally, car rental companies face fleet management challenges, vehicle underutilization, and high operational costs.
There is a need for a comprehensive car rental system that delivers real-time information on vehicle availability, transparent pricing, a simple booking process, and outstanding customer service. This solution should also help automobile rental companies manage their fleets more efficiently, increase vehicle usage, and cut operational expenses.

> The proposed software engineering project aims to design and construct a car rental system that deals with these issues while meeting the needs of both customers and car rental providers. The system will be evaluated based on its usability & efficiency.


## Solution Proposed
The proposed solution is a comprehensive car rental system that takes advantage of new technologies to address the market's recognized issues. Here are the main components of the solution:

- Real-Time Vehicle Availability: The system will provide real-time updates on the availability of vehicles. Customers may check and book available cars immediately, which improves their rental experience.

- Transparent Pricing: The system's pricing structure would be clear and transparent. All costs, including the base price, taxes, and any additional charges, will be fully specified, with no hidden fees.

- Customer Service: The system will feature a module to effectively handle consumer inquiries and complaints. This increases client happiness and loyalty.

- Easy Booking Procedure: The system will streamline the booking procedure, saving time and effort when renting a car. Customers can book a car in a few easy steps.

- Vehicle Listing:  It will provide information about vehicles that are available.

-  Operational Efficiency: By automating numerous procedures such as booking, billing, the technology will lower automobile rental companies' operational costs.

## Project Scope

The aim of this project is to design and develop a comprehensive car rental system that improves the car rental experience for customers and enhances operational efficiency for car rental companies.
 
Main Objectives:
- Real-Time Vehicle Availability: Develop a feature that provides real-time updates on the availability of cars, allowing customers to view and book available cars instantly.

- Transparent price: Establish a clear and transparent price structure, with all costs clearly mentioned and no hidden costs.

- Easy Booking Process: Simplify the booking process, allowing clients to reserve a car in a few simple steps, minimizing the time and effort required to rent a car.

-  Create a customer service module to successfully manage client inquiries and complaints, resulting in increased customer satisfaction and loyalty.


## Application Description

1. User Registration and Authentication: The system will include secure user registration and authentication capabilities. Customers can create an account by providing their email address and password. This functionality will also provide password recovery possibilities.

2. Real-Time Vehicle Availability: The system will provide real-time information on car availability. Customers can filter available automobiles based on their choices, such as car model, location, and price.

3. Transparent Pricing: The system will display a complete breakdown of the rental price, including the base price, taxes, and any additional fees. This ensures pricing transparency and allows customers to make informed selections.

4. Booking and Payment: Customers can book a car in a few simple steps. The system will support multiple payment options such as credit card, debit card, and cash.

5. Booking History and Receipts: Customers can examine their booking history and download receipts from previous rentals. This tool enables clients to keep track of their costs.

6. Customer Service: The system will contain a customer service module where users may submit questions or complaints. They can also rate and review the renting experience.

7. Customers will receive updates regarding impending bookings, changes in booking status, and special offers. Notifications can be sent via email or SMS, depending on the customer's preferences.

8. Security: To protect client data and transactions, the system will include methods such as data encryption and secure payment processing.
