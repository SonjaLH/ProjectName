    Technologies Used
The car rental system is built with a combination of current and reliable technologies. The backend logic is written in PHP, a popular server-side scripting language known for its adaptability and interoperability with a variety of operating systems. The frontend, or user interface, is developed with HTML and CSS, the standard technology for structuring and decorating web pages. To improve the user interface and make it responsive, the Bootstrap framework is used. Bootstrap has pre-designed components, which makes the development process easier. A MySQL database stores the system's data, such as user information and automobile rental details. MySQL is a dependable and efficient open-source relational database management system that is commonly used for online applications. These technologies provide a comprehensive, efficient, and user-friendly car rental system.

    User Interface Design:

1. An idea how our Landing Page will look:

<p align="center">
    <img src="src\img\mockups\Rent.png" alt="Car Rental System Class Diagram">
    <br />
</p>

2. Also the login interface:

<p align="center">
    <img src="src\img\mockups\Capturelogin.PNG" alt="Car Rental System Class Diagram">
    <br />
</p>


    Security Measures:

The following security measures and protocols will be implemented:

* Encryption -> This entails transforming data into code to prevent unauthorized access. Sensitive data, such as user passwords and payment information, is typically encrypted both in transit (using protocols like SSL/TLS) and at rest in the database.

* Authentication -> This is the process of authenticating a user's identification. It usually consists of a login and password, but it can also contain other techniques like two-factor authentication (2FA) for extra protection.

* Role Access Management -> This entails creating roles (such as administrator, staff, and client) and providing precise permissions to each one. For example, an administrator may have complete access to the system, whilst a client can only view and change their own booking information. This helps to restrict access to sensitive sections of the system to those who require it.


## Software Design and Modeling (Phase III)

## Software Architecture

System Architecture

We will design the car rental system to work seamlessly by integrating various components to provide a user-friendly experience. Here's how different parts of the system will interact with each other, in order to make renting cars easy and efficient:
 - User Interface (UI):
 We will create a user-friendly interface where customers can easily search for available cars, select rental dates, and make reservations. Users will also view detailed information about the cars, such as model, features, and pricing.
- Database Management:	Our database system will store essential information about available cars, customer details, reservations, rental history, etc. This database will allow efficient data retrieval and storage to support various functions of the system.
- Backend Services:
The backend services that we’re going to develop will handle the core business logic of the system, such as processing reservations, calculating rental fees, and more. 
- Secure Payment Gateway:
We will have a secure payment gateway to facilitate online payments for reservations. This ensures that transactions are processed smoothly and securely, providing users with a seamless payment experience.
- Admin Panel:
For system management, we will develop an intuitive admin panel that’s going to allow admin to manage the system efficiently. Admins can add new cars, update pricing, handle customer support, generate reports, and access analytics to make informed decisions.
- Notification System:
We will implement a notification system to keep users informed about their reservations, payment status, and any updates related to their rental. This ensures that users are always updated on the status of their bookings.
